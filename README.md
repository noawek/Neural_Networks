# About ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains the code and materials for my project in the Neural Networks course ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡.
The project explores the application of neural network models to understand brain functions and neural processes. It includes MATLAB-based implementations of various network architectures, simulations, and experiments designed to mimic biological neural networks
