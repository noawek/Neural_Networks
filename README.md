# About ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains code and materials of my projects in Neural Networks course ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡.
It explores the application of neural network models to understand brain functions and neural processes. It includes MATLAB-based implementations of various network architectures, simulations, and experiments designed to mimic biological neural networks.
